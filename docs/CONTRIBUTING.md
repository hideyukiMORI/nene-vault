# Contributing

NeNe Vault is built through small, Issue-driven changes. This document is the shared entry point for humans and AI agents.

## Collaboration Policy

Follow [`docs/workflow.md`](workflow.md) — inherited from [NENE2](https://github.com/hideyukiMORI/NENE2/blob/main/docs/workflow.md):

1. Create or reuse a GitHub Issue **before** editing.
2. Branch from `main` as `type/issue-number-summary`.
3. Implement, verify (`composer check` when applicable), commit with `(#issue)`.
4. Push, open PR with `Closes #number`, merge after checks — **do not push directly to `main`**.

- Use one branch and one PR per focused work unit.
- Keep `docs/milestones/`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and `docs/todo/current.md` updated when direction changes.
- Explain intent, impact, verification, and remaining risk in PRs.
- Prefer documentation that helps the next developer or AI agent decide what to do without rereading chat history.

## Secrets

Do not commit passwords, tokens, private URLs, production credentials, or local `.env` files. Commit only non-secret examples such as `.env.example` when needed.

Sensitive keys for this product include:

- Admin JWT secrets
- Invoice upstream API bearer token (and optional NeNe Records / NeNe Concierge tokens)
- SMTP credentials for dunning email delivery

## Engineering Theme

NeNe Vault should stay readable, secure, and self-hostable:

- strict, typed, explicit boundaries (inherited from NENE2)
- decoupled use cases and infrastructure
- OpenAPI contracts before client assumptions
- Reconciliation/dunning compliance enforced at the API layer; no quote/invoice/tax/PDF logic (ADR 0009)
- MCP access only through documented HTTP boundaries
- **never** merge into or embed inside NeNe Records (ADR 0002)

## Upstream Framework

Runtime HTTP, middleware, and DI patterns come from [NENE2](https://github.com/hideyukiMORI/NENE2). When framework behavior is unclear, read NENE2 docs under `vendor/hideyukimori/nene2/docs/` after `composer install`.
